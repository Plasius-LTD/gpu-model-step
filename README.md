# @plasius/gpu-model-step

STEP analytic geometry import/export and controlled tessellation contracts.

This repository is the dedicated package boundary defined by ADR 0094.

## Bootstrap status

This initial repository contains the approved schema baseline, legal and governance files, and a package smoke-test surface. Functional model conversion work is tracked in the repository's [TASK] issues and must flow through the canonical GPU model boundary.

## Rollout

- Feature flag: gpu.model.conversion.enabled
- Capability: none for this package-only layer
- Rollback: disable the feature flag and keep the published package version pinned to the last validated release

## Development

Requires Node.js 24 and npm.

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
npm pack --dry-run
```

## Release integrity

CI keeps the administrative contributor registry outside Git and npm package
artifacts using exact, case-normalised path checks. CI runs on explicit
GitHub-hosted runners. Publication uses the GitHub-hosted `production` job with
Node 24 and a pinned npm 11.6.2 client. It is token-free and proceeds only while
the prepared SHA is the exact `main` head after successful push-triggered CI.
The completed `0.1.0` bootstrap path has been removed; subsequent releases must
use npm trusted publishing.
