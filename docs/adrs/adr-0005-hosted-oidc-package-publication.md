# ADR-0005: Hosted OIDC Package Publication

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-11

## Context

`@plasius/gpu-model-step` must publish without a long-lived npm write token and without
accepting CI evidence for another source snapshot.

## Decision

Publication is phase-isolated: dependency installation, package validation, SBOM generation, and immutable tarball packing run in `validate_and_pack` without the `production` environment or OIDC permission. The final hosted `publish` job downloads only that sealed artifact, explicitly installs npm 11.6.2, runs no repository dependency code, and publishes the tarball with lifecycle scripts disabled. It re-fetches current `main` immediately before the first release mutation and again immediately before npm publication. `.npmrc` contains no registry-auth placeholder, and release preparation returns the reviewed current `main` HEAD rather than package-file history.

Publish only from the GitHub-hosted `production` job using npm trusted
publishing. Prove the prepared SHA is still the exact remote `main` head and
that push-triggered `ci.yml` succeeded for it. Require Node 24 and npm 11.5.1 or
newer, request provenance, and prohibit reusable or automatic npm write-token
fallbacks. Same-repo PR CI may use explicit self-hosted runners; fork PR code is
denied.

### First-publication bootstrap

npm cannot bind this package to its trusted publisher before the package exists.
The initial `0.1.0` publication therefore has a temporary, explicitly selected
`bootstrap_first_publish` path inside the same `cd.yml` and `production`
boundary. It reuses the immutable artifact and exact-main/CI checks, refuses any
other version, and refuses the credential if the package name already exists.
The short-lived credential is materialized only in a mode-`0600` runner-temporary
user configuration and erased on step exit. This is not a fallback: the
credential, environment secret, and bootstrap path are removed after `0.1.0`,
and a later patch release must prove OIDC before release readiness is complete.

## Consequences

Missing trust configuration, moved `main`, absent CI, unsupported runtime, or
missing OIDC identity fails closed before publication.

## Test implications

Workflow tests enforce source, CI, runtime, identity, runner, and token rules.
